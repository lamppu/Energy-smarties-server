Gitignore from
https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Node.gitignore

To get started
- clone the repository
- run "npm install" to install dependencies
- run "npm start" to start the server
- add a .gitignore file
- there will be a .env file added with the db connection stuff, I'll add the things needed to teams soon
