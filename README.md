Gitignore from
https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Node.gitignore

To get started
- clone the repository
- run "npm install" in project root folder to install dependencies
- add a .env file (in the project root) with the db connection stuff, you can find the contents you should add in the Developers channel in Teams, I've posted it on October 23rd
- run "npm start" to start the server


## Conventions

This project uses ESLinter to check code formatting and style.

To run the linter manually, use:  
```npm run lint```

To attempt to fix linter issues automatically, use:  
```npm run lint-fix```

Note that not all errors can be fixed automatically.
